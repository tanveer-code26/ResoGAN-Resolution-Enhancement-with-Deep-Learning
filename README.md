# 🌟 ResoGAN - Resolution Enhancement with Deep Learning  

## 🚀 Overview  
**ResoGAN** is a deep learning-based image quality enhancement tool that uses a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to upscale low-resolution images. This project leverages **TensorFlow** and **Streamlit** to provide a user-friendly web interface for real-time image enhancement.  

## 🔥 Features  
✅ **Deep Learning-Powered Enhancement** – Uses a trained GAN to improve image quality.  
✅ **User-Friendly Interface** – Upload an image and enhance it instantly using **Streamlit**.  
✅ **Fast and Efficient** – Processes images quickly with a pre-trained generator model.  
✅ **Supports Multiple Formats** – Works with **JPG, JPEG, and PNG** files.

```
Upload a low-resolution image, and **ResoGAN** will enhance its quality!  

## 📷 Example Results  
| Input (Low-Resolution) | Output (Enhanced) |
|------------------------|-------------------|
| ![Low-Res](assets/low_res.jpg) | ![High-Res](assets/high_res.jpg) |

(*Replace with actual before/after images.*)  

## 📌 Future Improvements  
✅ **Train on a Larger Dataset** for even better image enhancement.  
✅ **Increase Model Resolution** to support higher-quality images.  
✅ **Mobile & Web Deployment** using Flask or FastAPI.
